- 👋 Hi, I’m @lamiasoualhi (nickname is Mia).
- 👀 I’m interested in web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, hoping to start learning Python and react very soon (highly doubt it since I have school).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, I don't know, just testing things out, i'm actually an architecture student, this is a hobby I just picked!
- 📫 How to reach me: my facebook: Lamia Soualhi
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm also into photography/videography, mixed media, abstract art and line art, 3d modeling, I'd love to dabble into game development in the near future as well :) thank you if you're here.
- Please check out my projects and give me feedback, I'd be really appreciative, thank you again.
